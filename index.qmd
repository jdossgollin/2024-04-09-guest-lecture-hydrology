### What size culvert should we install to manage stormwater? {style="margin-top: 1em;"}

::: {.fragment}
Let's break down the steps to answer this question.
:::
:::
:::

## Example workflow for culvert sizing

::: {.incremental}
1. Select an appropriate reliability level, e.g. $T=10$ years
1. From observations, estimate $T$ year _return level_ for rainfall intensity at a relevant duration, $i^*$
1. Calculate peak flow, (e.g.: $Q^* = C i^* A$ where $i^*$ is peak rainfall intensity, $A$ is area, and $C$ is runoff coefficient)
1. Size your culvert to handle $Q^* = Ci^*A$
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
## Thinking critically

- What is the main source of uncertainty in this workflow?
- How might climate change affect the reliability of this approach?

## How high to elevate a house to proactively reduce flood damages?

![{{< fa camera >}}:  Rob Nichols, PSU](_assets/img/nichols-ocracoke.jpeg)

::: {.fragment}
Elevating homes can reduce flood damage, but how do we determine the optimal elevation height?
:::

## Example workflow for house elevation

::: {.incremental}
1. Develop depth-damage curve
1. Estimate flood frequency at the site
1. Calculate discounted net present value of damages over time
1. Repeat for different elevation heights
1. Select the elevation height that minimizes total costs (elevation + expected damages)

![Brian Bartholomew](_assets/img/bartholomew-ercot-feb21.jpg)

## Example workflow for electricity supply

::: {.incremental}
1. We need the **joint** distribution of demand and supply
1. Estimate winter peak demand
    1. Generate many sequences of hourly weather
    1. For each, estimate hourly demand
1. For each sequence, estimate supply...
:::

## Physical risk disclosure

![[SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-31)](_assets/img/sec-disclosure.png)

::: {.fragment}
New SEC rules require companies to disclose climate-related risks. How can flood risk assessment support this?
:::

## Design a sponge city

::: {.fragment}
Sponge cities use nature-based solutions to manage flood risk. What data and models are needed to design effective sponge city strategies?
:::

## Key insights

::: {.incremental}
1. Flood modeling is just one part of flood risk assessment and management
1. Need not only accurate flood models, but also to run them many times to explore uncertainties
1. Need to understand drivers of flood hazard and risk, and how they may change over time
1. Flood risk assessment can inform a wide range of decisions, from infrastructure design to financial disclosure

- Boundary conditions
   - Extreme value analysis
   - Multivariate analysis
   - Stochastic weather generators
   - Downscaling
:::

And much more!
:::

## How can we estimate the probability of rare, extreme events?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Floods are often caused by extreme rainfall or storm surge
- But the most extreme events are rare, so how can we estimate their probability?
- Extreme value analysis provides a framework for this problem
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

## Extreme value analysis: Methods for estimating the probability of rare events

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Image: Equations for the GEV and GPD distributions, and a diagram illustrating the block maxima and peaks-over-threshold approaches]
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Extreme value distributions (GEV, GPD) are used to model the distribution of extreme events, given observed maxima
- These distributions allow for extrapolation beyond the observed data
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
## Thinking critically
Given what you know about the physical processes that cause floods, does it make sense to extrapolate the probability of extreme events beyond what we've observed?
:::

## Why do we need multivariate analysis for flood risk assessment?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Some types of flooding, like coastal flooding, depend on multiple variables (e.g., rainfall and storm surge)
- To accurately assess the risk, we need to understand the joint behavior of these variables
- Multivariate analysis allows us to model the dependence between variables
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

## Copulas: A tool for modeling dependence in multivariate analysis

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Image: Examples of different copula families (Gaussian, Clayton, Gumbel) and their density contours]
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Copula models can capture the dependence structure between variables
- They separate the marginal distributions from the dependence structure
- This allows for modeling complex relationships and simulating joint behavior
:::
:::

## Generating realistic weather sequences: Why do we need more than just historical data?

- For applications like water resources analysis and resource adequacy, we need long sequences of weather data
- Historical data is limited and may not capture the full range of possible conditions
- Single-variate extreme value analysis is insufficient, especially when storage is involved

::: {.callout-tip}
## Thinking critically
What are some limitations of relying solely on historical weather data for long-term planning and risk assessment?
:::

## Stochastic weather generators and downscaling: Generating synthetic weather data

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Stochastic weather generators
- Pros: Uses real data, computationally cheap, can generate long sequences, understandable
- Cons: Limited by observed range, can overfit, may not capture climate change
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Downscaling
- Pros: High-resolution, leverages climate model simulations, can generate physically plausible synthetic weather
- Cons: Computationally expensive, requires understanding of climate models, climate model biases can be difficult to correct
:::
:::

## Running flood models multiple times: The need for surrogate models

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Many applications, such as project screening or optimization, require running flood models hundreds or thousands of times
- But complex flood models can be computationally expensive, making this infeasible
- Surrogate models (also called emulators) can provide a fast approximation of the complex model
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Image: Diagram showing the process of building a surrogate model from input-output data of a complex model]
:::
:::

## Surrogate modeling: Approximating complex models for efficient computation

- Surrogate models are fast, approximate models that can be used in place of complex, computationally expensive models
- They are trained on input-output data from the complex model
- Once trained, they can provide near-instant predictions, enabling applications like optimization and sensitivity analysis

![Image: Example of a surrogate model architecture, such as from @kazadi_neurips:2022]

## Remote sensing: A tool for flood mapping and monitoring

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Flooding can occur over large areas, making it difficult to monitor on the ground
- Satellite imagery provides a way to map flood extent and depth remotely
- But there are challenges, like cloud cover and shadows, that need to be addressed
:::

## Methods for flood mapping and monitoring using remote sensing

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Image: Diagram of a CNN architecture for flood extent mapping from satellite imagery]
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to classify satellite imagery into flooded and non-flooded areas
- Other methods include supervised classification algorithms (SVM, random forest), unsupervised clustering (k-means, ISODATA), and data fusion techniques

# Getting philosophical

## Flood risk assessment faces large and often irreducible uncertainties

- Many sources of uncertainty: future emissions, climate models, hydrologic models, exposure and vulnerability
- Some uncertainties are inherently irreducible, such as future human behavior and decision-making
- Need to communicate and manage uncertainty in flood risk assessment and decision-making

## Subjective choices in representing uncertainties affect outcomes

- Different methods for representing uncertainty (e.g., probability distributions, scenarios) can lead to different results
- Subjective choices, such as the selection of probability distributions or the definition of scenarios, can have a significant impact
- Important to be transparent about these choices and to explore the sensitivity of results to different assumptions

## Open science is critical due to lack of consensus approaches

- No single "best" approach for flood risk assessment and uncertainty quantification
- Open science enables reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration
- Allows for the comparison and integration of different approaches, leading to more robust and credible results

## Tools and resources for open workflows

- Version control systems (e.g., Git, GitHub) for code and data management
- Jupyter / Quarto Notebooks for literate programming and reproducible analysis
- Containerization tools (e.g., Docker) for reproducible computational environments
- Open data platforms (e.g., Zenodo, Hydroshare) for data sharing and archiving
- Resources like Software Carpentry for learning best practices in scientific computing

# Conclusion

## Recap: Flood risk assessment, data science, and the importance of open science

1. Flood risk assessment requires modeling exposure, vulnerability, and boundary conditions, and hydrodynamics
1. Probabilistic methods like extreme value analysis and multivariate analysis are essential for estimating rare events and modeling dependence
- Uncertainty is inherent in flood risk assessment, and subjective choices in representing uncertainty can affect outcomes
- Open science is critical for transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in flood risk assessment

## Encouragement: Develop statistical/ML and programming skills for effective flood risk management

::: {.incremental}
- Skills in statistics, machine learning, and programming are increasingly important for flood risk assessment and management
- These skills enable the application of advanced data science methods and the implementation of open and reproducible workflows
- Seek out courses, workshops, and resources to develop these skills!
- Without domain expertise, these skills are less useful!
